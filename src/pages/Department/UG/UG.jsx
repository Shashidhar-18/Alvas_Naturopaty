          Our undergraduate programs focus on holistic education in naturopathy and yogic sciences.
          We aim to provide a well-rounded curriculum that blends traditional knowledge with modern science.
          Our curriculum enables the students to play the role of an effective naturopathic practitioner and fulfill the responsibilities of a medical graduate in both rural & urban environment confidently & competently.
          Education without character & discipline is futile, especially in the medical field. Our institution emphasizes character building along with academic learning.
